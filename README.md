# lisp-compiler

A simple lisp compiler for the x86 system made in C. The language this lisp compiler compiles probably has nothing in common with most lisp dialects, and probably has more in common with C than with Common Lisp.

The code generator is targeting 32-bit Intel *86 processors, assemblies are written in GAS syntax.
